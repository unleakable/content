# What do we do to stop the leaks?

This question can probably best be answered if we compare how the current systems aim to combat the issue of leaks with an ideal one.
Some of the most common suggestions that you'll hear from people include:

> Add more security to the process. Harsher punishments for leaks and cheating. Use every law in the books to set an example. Install cameras everywhere. Transport the papers with military grade security. Actually, just transport the papers with the military.

> Alternatively, you could use the digital with the electronic on the blockchain with the technology and the computers using the smartphones with the technology and the coding and encryption and the software with the password and top secret and stuff and things and yeah.

What? The issue here, is that these just address the issue of distribution and nothing more. 

## So, what can really be done to stop the leaks?

It's a multi-step process. 

We have a **giant system** (F1) that doesn't react fast. There are **multiple points of failure** (F2), and the **tiniest failure** (F3) can derail the whole process. 

Simply put, even a single fault can bring the whole system to it's knees. And all three of these issues together?

These leaks are a symptom of those three problems. Solving the leaks problem requires the solution of those *sub problems*.

Perhaps we need to look at how we:

* *Simplify* the organization
* *Reduce* the points of failure 
* *Increase* failure tolerance

The first one is an administrative challenge for the CBSE/government to solve.

The second one *seems* like a problem that technology could solve. Corruption creeps in when a large number of people are involved in distribution.

But the third issue. That's much more viable. Leaking a single question paper on social media is devastating. If we view a test as a technical challenge that you solve to demonstrate your grasp of the subject matter in general, a leaked test paper allows the *leakee* to optimize their work towards the specific subject matter presented on the exam, despite (presumably) having little knowledge about the subject matter in general.

The devastation is a consequence of the fact that:

* a subset of examinees have found an easy way to breeze through the exam without having a grasp of the subject matter, making the whole exercise meaningless for other students. 
* since the question paper is common for everybody, **it's impossible to tell what subset of examinees benefitted from the leak**. It could be everybody for all you know. Or it could be just one maverick *leakee* who managed to stay quiet until the results came in.

In the of this whitepaper, we lay out how we can build a leak resistant system by making leaks non-catastrophic.
