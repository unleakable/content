# Why the furore?

In March 2018, AISSCE examinees found themselves a part of a national controversy, when it came to light that some students had recieved pictures of the question paper several hours before the exam. Some students made the claim that this was a usual event before every exam, and they were being ignored.

But on March 26th, Delhi's education minister received a copy of the paper before the test and the CBSE, now having irrefutable proof of a leak, scrambled to respond. Parents and students took to streets. So what was the underlying reason driving these protests?

Was it:
* the effect it had by disrupting people's plans to study, vacation or write other tests?
* the effect it had on the credibility of CBSE and the value of its accreditation?
* the annoyance people felt for being punished for no fault of theirs?
