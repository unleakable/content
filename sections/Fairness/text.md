In the current system, unfairness appears to stem from these sources:

* Leak events cause some students to have **prior knowledge about the paper**
* **Different sets** of question papers or a **system of zones** might have **different levels of difficulty**
* The examinations are **probabilistic**, and students who haven't mastered everything are at a disadvantage.

This solution effectively nullifies the first one, as it would become impossible to have prior knowledge about the question paper. This is because no two people will get the same paper, and leaks can no longer damage the integrity of the examinations as they aren't beneficial or profitable to anyone. It will also be easier to remove leaked papers from circulation and track down their source. 

With this solution, the problem of differing difficulty across sets and zones no longer occurs as there are no sets and zones. As a bonus, this system makes the practice of copying fruitless, for obvious reasons.
