The problem could be solved by generating unique question papers for every candidate. 

* The question papers are procedurally generated, and have a unique code printed on them. This code, or the 'seed' if you will is a well covered concept and is used in most procedures to reproduce an event. 
* This unique code can then be used to access the generated answer sheet by the examiner.
* Since every examinee gets a unique question paper, there is no point in leaking question papers. The monetary incentive to leak disappears, and so do the leakers.
* Even *if* a paper is leaked, it wouldn't affect the exam. Since every paper is unique, a paper leak would simply render that question paper (or in a larger leak, of several papers) or a batch of papers invalid. The examination would be able to proceed by the invigilator simply not distributing a leaked batch, and switching over to a backup set.

We'll cover the implementation in a bit.
