The costs: 

* Computers would be required at evaluation time. However, it appears that computers are already in use during evaluation.
* The algorithm and dataset to generate the papers would be relatively inexpensive, and it would be a one-time cost.
* Evaluation might take a little longer.

The benefits: 

* Leaks are no longer an issue, and therefore security spending could be reduced.
* Papers could be printed remotely, and transportation costs could be saved.
* An unleakable exam would save costs of re-examination, and losses borne by the candidates.
