From the CBSE's public releases, it appears that the board intends to move back to its original system of using several question paper sets for the whole country. This doesn't solve the major issue: leaks would still be catastrophic

Some of the other common *solutions* to the leaks appear to be of these two categories:

* **More security**: Security is one of those things that tends to have diminishing returns. Adding more security is probably not going to work. You don't fix leaking pipes with cellotape.
* **More technology**: Calls to digitize are misdirected. Digitizing might stave off some of the issues temporarily, but don't address the fact that leaks would still be devastating. People feel that a fully digital solution would have astronomical costs, which we could do well to avoid.


A better solution could be found by solving one of the systemic problems explored in the previous section.
